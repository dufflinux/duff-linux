Hello Thank you for trying d77void.

## Installers

To run Calamares:

```
su

calamares
```


To run the tui installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

# NEWS

- Brave browser is now the default browser;

- Hyprlock configured;

- new d77-welcome script available and corrected;

- some minor changes in keybinds;

- to use calamares just call rofi and select installer


## 1st run:

After install, run the script d77-welcome:

```
d77-welcome
```

That way the hyprland repo will be added to /etc/xbps.d and you can add easily other things like steam, flatpak, etc.

# Keybinds

super + return -> terminal

super + q -> close window

super + shift + q -> logout

super + b -> swap background

super + c -> control pannel

super + d -> menu

super + f -> file manager

super + n -> nwg-grid

super + t -> lock screen

super + w -> web browser

super + x -> powermenu

Have fun!
